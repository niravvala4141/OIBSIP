                            with the first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), developed under the
                            stewardship of Dr. Kalam.</span></h3>
                    <p>SLV-3 was successfully launched on July 18, 1980 from Sriharikota Range (SHAR), when Rohini
                        satellite, RS-1, was placed in orbit, thereby making India the sixth member of an exclusive club
                        of space-faring nations . SLV-3 employed an open loop guidance (with stored pitch programme) to
                        steer the vehicle in flight along a pre-determined trajectory. The first experimental flight of
                        SLV-3, in August 1979, was only partially successful. Apart from the July 1980 launch, there
                        were two more launches held in May 1981 and April 1983, orbiting Rohini satellites carrying
                        remote sensing sensors.

                        The successful culmination of the SLV-3 project showed the way to advanced launch vehicle
                        projects such as the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                        (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).</p>

                    <h3>1992-1999: works as Chief Scientific Advisor to the PM and Secretary of the DRDO.</h3>
                    <p>Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence
                        Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear
                        tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and
                        technological role.

                        Before joining DRDO, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was the project leader of the indigenous Indian
                        Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) at ISRO. His biggest achievement in ISRO came with the successful
                        launch of SLV-3, which jettisoned Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit. In June 1982, Dr
                        Kalam shouldered the responsibility of shaping the missile development programme. His moment of
                        reckoning in DRDO came with the successful completition of the IGMDP. The success of the missile
                        programme demonstrated his concept of management by partnership and the sobriquet ‘the Missile
                        Man of India’. He later rose to became the first citizen of the country. He is still remembered
                        as the ‘People’s President’.</p>

                        coordinator</h3>
                    <p>he Bharatiya Janata Party came back to power in March 1998 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee once again
                        became the Prime Minister of India. On April 8, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) chief R
                        Chidambaram and DRDO chief APJ Abdul Kalam were summoned and given thumbs up for the tests.
                        Vajpayee and his principal secretary Brajesh Mishra controlled the entire operation from the
                        Prime Minister’s Office. The operation was conducted in such high secrecy that nobody except the
                        then Home minister LK Advani knew about it.

                        Even Defence minister George Fernandes was told about the tests on May 9 and the three service
                        chiefs and foreign secretary were informed over the next three days. The information was shared
                        by the Cabinet Committee on Security on May 11.</p>
