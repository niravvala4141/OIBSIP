                    <h3>1999-2001: Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India.</h3>
                    <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, President of India from 2002-2007 and one of India’s most distinguished
                        scientists addressed the participants on the conference on the “Future of Space Exploration”,
                        co-organized by the Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future and the Center for
                        Space Physics, at Boston University. In this wide-ranging address, from India over
                        video-conference, Dr. Kalam laid out the various challenges that lie before space scientists and
                        stressed that the greatest of all challenges is to use science to the benefit of humankind,
                        particularly to the benefit of the poorest communities and people around the world. He outlines
                        various areas and applications in which space science and exploration can help contribute to
                        greater human development.

                        Marking the 50th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the 40th anniversary of the
                        Outer Space Treaty, this Pardee Center conference brought together leading space scientists,
                        visionaries, and entrepreneurs from around the world to imagine the next half-century of space
                        exploration. The conference resulted in a vision statement by the participants outlining five
                        key areas of concern for the next 50 years.</p>

                        Management in Shillong.</h3>
                    <p>A sense of shock and disbelief pervaded among the students and staff of the Indian Institute of
                        Management (IIM) here who had witnessed the final moments of former president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
                        when he collapsed while delivering a lecture.
                        Kalam, who was the President of India from 2002 to 2007, begun his lecture on ‘Creating a
                        Liveable Planet’ to the second year students of IIM-Shillong.
                        About 15 minutes into his speech, while sharing his experiences, he suddenly fainted and fell
                        down around 6.30 p.m. The medical officer of IIM in the Meghalaya capital tried to revive him
                        but failed.

                        Management in Shillong.</h3>
                    <p>Kalam was then rushed to Bethany hospital. A team of doctors from the military hospital and
                        NEIGRH&MS, who were also present at the hospital, tried to revive him. He was however, declared
                        dead due to a massive cardiac arrest at 7.45 p.m.
                        “The IIM-Shillong community is still in a state of shock and sorrow that our former president is
                        no more. I have still not come to terms with the passing away of Kalam,” IIM-Shillong director
                        Amitabha De said. Students who saw the last few minutes of the former president said he entered
                        the IIM-Shillong auditorium full of energy.
                        PTI Adds: Former President A P J Abdul Kalam had congratulated a constable for remaining alert
                        throughout the day, minutes before he collapsed at the Indian Institute of Management and died
                        here last night.
                        “The former President congratulated an SOT (special operation team) personnel for being alert
                        throughout the road trip from Guwahati to Shillong…,” East Khasi Hills district SP M Kharkrang
                        said.</p>
