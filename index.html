                            Nadu.</span></h3>
                    <p><b><i>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</i></b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim
                        family in the
                        pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the
                        State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local
                        mosque. his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that
                        took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited
                        Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
                        family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
                        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy
                        Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was
                        poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born</p>

                        in orbit.


                        Kalam also directed projects which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of
                        the successful SLV programme in the 1970s.

                        lives.

                        came out in 1994, was made from surgical-grade stainless steel provided by MIDHANI (Mishra Dhatu
                        Nigam, a public sector undertaking) in Hyderabad. It paved the way for the production of
